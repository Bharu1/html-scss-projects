# Simple Omelette Recipe
This project is a simple, responsive webpage that displays a recipe for a classic omelette. The page is styled using HTML and SCSS, providing a clean and easy-to-navigate layout for users. It is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile screens.

# Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure of the page.
SCSS (Sassy CSS): For styling, including variables, nesting, and other features for modular and maintainable code.

# Features
Responsive Design: The page layout adjusts automatically for desktop and mobile screens.
Easy-to-Follow Recipe: Includes preparation and cooking times, a list of ingredients, and step-by-step cooking instructions.
Nutritional Information: Displays basic nutritional values per serving.
Centered Content on Mobile: All elements are centered for optimal readability on mobile devices.

# You can expand this project with different technologies for enhanced functionality and interactivity:

JavaScript: Add dynamic elements such as interactive ingredient selection, animated steps, or user reviews.
React: Create components for each section (e.g., ingredients, instructions, and nutrition) to make the page modular and reusable. This could also allow for data fetching if you wanted to load recipes from a database or API.
